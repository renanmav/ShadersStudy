# Skia Shaders

This repository contains examples and resources for studying Skia shaders and .sksl files.

## What are Skia Shaders?

Skia is an open-source 2D graphics library that provides a wide range of features for rendering graphics, including support for shaders. Shaders are small programs that run on the GPU and allow you to create custom visual effects and manipulate the appearance of your graphics.

## .sksl File Support

Skia Shader Language (SkSL) is a domain-specific language used to write shaders for Skia, similar to the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL). SkSL files have the extension .sksl and contain the code that defines the behavior of the shaders.

This repository provides examples of SkSL files and demonstrates how to use them with Skia to create stunning visual effects.
